# datascribe
This Python package makes it easy for users to record important information about their datasets such as date/time, shape, title, reason, and URL in an Excel sheet. It simplifies data management and saves time, making it a must-have tool for data enthusiasts.

**Documentation**: Recording metadata in Excel can help users document their datasets and keep track of important details, such as when the data was collected, what it represents, and how it was processed.

**Collaboration**: If multiple users are working with the same dataset, having a centralized record of metadata can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and using the data correctly.

**Reproducibility**: By recording metadata in Excel, users can better document their data processing steps, making it easier to reproduce their analysis or share their work with others.

**Organization**: By keeping track of metadata in Excel, users can more easily search, filter, and sort their datasets, making it easier to find the information they need when they need it.
